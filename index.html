            The Food For All Foundation has started serving meals to homeless mothers.
            Currently, the NGO is feeding them in Vrindavan to ensure that they can live a life 
            of dignity and respect. Cooked meals are provided to a thousand of them to ensure 
            that women who live alone, are not devoid of healthy meals.

            This year, children from challenging socio-economic backgrounds have spent 6 months studying 
            at home (with or without healthy food), but, they yet have 4 more months to gain the best 
            of the knowledge and become healthier each day.

    <h1> Impact Story </h1>
    <section id="story">
    <h2> Prevent Food Waste By Leftover Food Donation </h2>
    <p>
    A study by Food Ministry, Government of India found that about 20% of food at social events 
    such as weddings goes waste. Food waste also occurs at parties, functions and restaurants.
    This is a sad state of affairs when one considers that two lakh street children in Delhi 
    go to sleep hungry every day. Therefore, leftover food donation is the need of the hour to 
    counter both malnutrition and food waste!<br><br></p>
    <h4>Spreading Hope, One Meal at a Time </h4>
    <p>
    But the impact didn't end within the restaurant's walls. Through 
    strategic partnerships with local shelters, soup kitchens, and 
    charitable organizations, the surplus food found its way into the hands
     of those in need. Every meal rescued from waste became a beacon of 
     hope for the hungry, a reminder that kindness knows no bounds.
    </p> <br><br>
    <h4>Join the Movement</h4>
<p>
    As we reflect on this impactful story, let it serve as a reminder 
    that each of us has the power to make a difference, no matter how small
    our actions may seem. Together, let's continue to turn waste into 
    wonder, spreading compassion and creating a brighter future for all.
